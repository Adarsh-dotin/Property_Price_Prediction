# Property Price Prediction: Data-Driven Real Estate Valuation

This project aims to build a predictive model for property prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors like location, number of rooms, area size, and more, the model predicts property prices with high accuracy. The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and engineered for better model performance.
